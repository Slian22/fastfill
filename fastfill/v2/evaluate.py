"""All-request, stage-separated evaluation for structured and text v2 models.

Besides the reference errors the report carries label-only baselines (room centre,
per-category mean position, per-category median size, uniform yaw), mode-collapse
diagnostics (every predicted object, the label-complete ground truth, and the predicted
objects matched to it, each with the out-of-room fraction), symmetry-aware yaw error counts per order, and a per-source
breakdown of all of the above.

``--projection full minimal`` also evaluates the three-field projection
(``project_minimal``: ``batch.render_minimal_condition`` with the training
augmentation's regrouping) over boundary-known axis-aligned rectangular rooms; the report's top
level is the first projection and ``projections`` holds the others. Objects whose
``validity.size_axis_swap_allowed`` is true score size and yaw under the
box-equivalent minimum over (sx, sy, yaw + k pi/2 with sx/sy swapped for odd k),
with the plain-convention errors reported beside them. Target validation is
counted per check code as pass / violation / unknown. ``max_length`` comes from the
checkpoint (``io.load_checkpoint_config``) unless given explicitly; model settings
come from its ``model_config.json``. Reports record the checkpoint, its binding,
and the data and code sha256.

``baselines_paired`` scores the baselines on the model reference's own requests (those with a layout);
``validation`` counts validator collisions and clean rooms (no hard violation) for the layouts and, under the same
validator, for their labels. ``--save-head-outputs DIR`` keeps every request's head outputs;
``--from-head-outputs DIR`` re-decodes and scores them on the CPU with the online result.

    """Collision-aware decoding of one scene's grid head (meters in, meters out); returns (xy, yaw, z).

    ``room`` may list ``fixed_objects`` (condition rows: bottom_center_m, size_local_m, yaw_rad): they never move,
    block cells like placed objects and can carry raised ones. ``requests`` (the slots' effective requests,
    ``validation.effective_support_requests``) supply ``id`` and ``support_parent``; ``fixed_z`` marks slots whose
    z the condition fixes (``fixed_position_mask[..., 2]``). Without them every object is undeclared.

    Objects are placed floor-standing before raised ones, parents before their declared children, largest
    footprint first; each takes its most probable cell whose footprint stays in the room (a footprint at most
    ``margin`` past a wall slides back inside first) and overlaps no placed
    or fixed object that shares its height interval (overlap / smaller footprint <= max_overlap). Identical
    requests, whose argmax cells coincide, therefore spread over their next most probable cells. If no
    candidate qualifies, the least overlapping one is used (for a declared child: on its parent).

    Declarations beat the predicted height: an object whose z is fixed stands at that z, one declared on
    "floor" stands on the floor, one declared on "wall" hangs at its rule height (below), and one declared on a request
    or fixed object stands on the parent's top: at its most probable top_k cell whose centre lies inside the
    parent's (placed) footprint, else at the free point of a 5 x 5 lattice over that footprint (inset by its
    own half extents) nearest its argmax decode, else at the least overlapping of these, so the declared
    support holds even at the cost of a collision. A declared child whose predicted bottom lies more than ``inner``
    below its parent's top (and not below its bottom) stands inside the parent instead, e.g. a book on a bookcase's
    inner shelf: it keeps that height (at least the parent's bottom) and the parent is no obstacle to it.

    A "wall" object is placed by rule: each top_k cell is projected
    onto the wall (side of the room's bounds) nearest that cell, back flush with it and facing into the room
    (local +X into the room, as every source wall object; a box predicted thinner along local Y with local +X along
    the wall nearest its argmax cell keeps that axis, turned a quarter; a ``keep_yaw`` slot keeps its yaw),
    sliding along the wall to stay inside; the first projection free of
    overlap wins (wall, floor and fixed objects sharing its height interval are obstacles), else the least
    overlapping one; one wider or deeper than the room is centred along that axis. It keeps its predicted z when
    that is over 0.15 m above the floor, else (a z near the floor is no evidence here) hangs centred ``hang_centre``
    above the floor; either is clamped to [floor, ceiling - its height] when ``room`` gives ``height_m`` (else only
    >= floor), and it is placed with the raised objects when it ends over 0.15 m above the floor.

    With yaw logits (they only switch the rule on), a floor-standing object whose candidate footprint ends within
    ``near_wall`` of a wall turns its back to that wall (as 97-99% of wall-adjacent training furniture) only by a
    half turn: its decoded ``yaw`` flips by pi when the flipped yaw faces away from that wall within 45 degrees, else
    it is kept. The model learns yaw only modulo pi (training takes the min over {y, y + pi}), so the flip chooses
    between the two facings of the predicted box and never turns the box: it is never rotated by a quarter turn and its
    footprint stays the same. By design it also turns an object that faced the wall on purpose (a chair facing a desk
    against it; symmetric yaw metrics do not see this), and only the nearest wall counts: in a corner, an object facing
    the second-nearest wall keeps facing it. Slots marked in ``keep_yaw`` (one bool per slot; ``serialize_predictions``
    marks objects whose orientation the request constrains) never turn: they keep ``yaw`` and their footprints are
    checked at it.

    An undeclared raised object (predicted bottom > 0.15 m above the floor) whose argmax cell lies over no placed or
    fixed floor-standing object holding its predicted bottom (from that object's bottom to 0.15 m over its top), and
    whose argmax footprint ends within ``near_wall`` of a wall, hangs there: it keeps its predicted z (clamped like a
    "wall" object's) at its most probable free cell (a painting over a sofa, a mirror on a bare wall; no declaration
    certifies the wall, so it is not projected onto it). Any other undeclared raised object rests on a
    floor-standing object: it takes its most probable cell (at least 10% as likely as its best) whose centre lies inside
    such an object's footprint and sits on the highest such top; with no such cell it goes to the floor at its
    most probable free cell. "Inside a footprint" (here and for declared parents) is tested in the supporting box's
    own frame, so a rotated table holds only points over its rotated top, and the parent lattice is laid out in it.
