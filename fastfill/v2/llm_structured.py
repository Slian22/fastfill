"""OptiScene-style LLM baseline (huggingface/example.py): modes ``structured`` and ``structured-harness``.

A module of its own so that llm_baseline.py, whose sha256 autorun binds today's paid ``prompt`` / ``harness`` runs to,
stays byte-identical to commit 510f1e0. Same rows (``evaluate.project_minimal`` of ``--data``, first ``--max-samples``),
same answer format (llm_baseline ``to_layout``) and the same output files as llm_baseline.

The request: one fixed instruction with one train demonstration (``STRUCTURED``, the system message, the same for every
request) and the request as [Task Room Type] / [Task Room Size] / [Task Objects] sections (``sections``: exactly the
fields FastFill gets). The answer: <reasoning>[Reason]...[/Reason]</reasoning><answer>[Design]{json}[/Design]</answer>.
OptiScene gives retrieved asset sizes; this request has none, so the LLM predicts them.

``structured`` asks once; ``structured-harness`` sends ``check_answer``'s problems back up to ``--repairs`` times and
keeps the last valid layout (a later unreadable answer or failed request keeps it). The problems use only the request
and the answer: an unreadable answer, ids not exactly once, non-finite or non-positive numbers, below the floor, above
the ceiling, a declared support not met, then llm_baseline ``problems`` (beyond a wall, overlapping footprints, a raised
object with nothing under it). In both modes an answer that is still no valid layout is asked again from scratch once.

Each prediction row records ``checks_first`` / ``checks_final`` (problems of the first / kept answer; for an unreadable
first answer the parse or number errors) and ``usage``; summary.json ``mean_checks_*``, ``prompt_sha256``, ``repairs``
and ``usage``. ``checks_*`` are harness diagnostics, not llm_baseline's ``problems_*``: score with evaluate only::

]
[/Example Objects]

[Example Reason]
The king size bed needs the most space, so it goes first: its headboard rests against a long wall, set in from the corners so that a nightstand fits on each side, and it faces into the room. The two nightstands flank the head of the bed against the same wall and face the same way as the bed. The wardrobe stands against the short wall beyond one nightstand, facing into the room with free space in front of its sliding doors. The floor around the foot of the bed and in front of the wardrobe stays open as the walkway.

STRUCTURED = """You are a skilled room layout designer. Your task is to place every object of [Task Objects] in a room of the given [Task Room Type] and [Task Room Size], choosing each object's size, position and facing. Follow this guidance:
(1) Place every listed object exactly once, under its own id; objects sharing a category are still separate objects. Do not add or drop objects.
(2) No sizes are given: choose a realistic width, depth and height for each object from its category and description.
(3) Avoid overlaps: bounding boxes must not intersect, except an object resting on another (its z is the top of the object under it and it stays within that object's footprint). An object with a support_parent stands on that object, or on the floor when it says floor.
(4) Place the large furniture first (beds, wardrobes, sofas, tables, cabinets) and prefer the walls and edges of the room, which keeps it spacious.
(5) Align objects parallel or perpendicular to the walls.
(6) Keep functional groups together: chairs at their table or desk and facing it, nightstands beside the bed, a sofa facing the TV or coffee table.
(7) Keep walkways clear so that every object can be reached and used.
(8) Keep every object inside the floor polygon and its top below the ceiling.
(9) Before giving coordinates, reason briefly step by step about the general arrangement: which objects need the most space or a fixed place, which belong together, and how people move through the room. Then report the design.
